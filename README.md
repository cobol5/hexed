## HEXED.EXE

This is a Hex Editor that I wrote for MS-DOS using Turbo Pascal back in the 1990s.
I thought I was being pretty clever calling it HEXED, and later found out that
pretty much everyone else called their Hex Editor the same thing.

You can try it out by running in DosEmu / JS-DOS 6.22 here:
